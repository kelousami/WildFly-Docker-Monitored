# Ansible & Docker example
In this "experimental" example, I'm creating several centos:7 images using Docker.
All images include SSH Server (so to provision them easily with Ansible)
Each image is targeted to specific usage, including: 
- Load-balancer 
- Reverse proxy
- Backend middleware (application server)
- Database
- Monitoring server (will also include tools such elastic search, for production usage)

Targeted technologies
- Ansible
- Docker

Also covered technologies :
- Nginx
- Wildfly 10 (with Oracle JDK 8)
- Postgresql
- Shinken & Elastic-search

-> still in progress
